# 💰 The Gold Loan Paradox: Why the Rich Default More Than the Poor  

When I joined my internship at an **NBFC (Non-Banking Financial Company)**, I expected loan repayment trends to be predictable:  
- Poor borrowers would struggle to pay EMIs.  
- Wealthier ones would easily manage repayments.  

But the data told me a completely **different story**…

## 📊 What I Discovered  

During my role as a **Business Analyst Intern**, I collaborated with the risk team to analyze repayment reports for our **Gold Loan portfolio**.  

Here’s what the data revealed:  

- **Higher the income → Higher the bounce rate.**  
- **Lower the income → Lower the bounce rate.**  
- **Middle class → Paid back 90%+ of their loans consistently.**  

> 💡 This was shocking: I assumed low-income borrowers would struggle the most, but they were **more disciplined** than many wealthy borrowers.

## 🔎 Why This Happens  

- **Middle-class borrowers**: Value their credit history, repay on time to maintain trust and credibility.  
- **Low-income borrowers**: Pledge limited assets with serious intent, making repayment their top priority.  
- **High-income borrowers**: Sometimes treat loans casually, assuming they can afford defaults or negotiate later.

Here’s a simple summary of repayment behavior:

| Low Income     | Low         | 80–85%      |
| Middle Class   | Very Low    | 90%+        |
| High Income    | High        | 60–70%      |

## 🏦 Why It Matters for NBFCs  

This insight helped the NBFC’s **risk team**:  
- Rethink customer profiling.  
- Design smarter lending strategies.  
- Focus on the **middle-class reliability factor**.  

By challenging assumptions, data led us to smarter business decisions.

## ✨ The Takeaway  

In lending, it’s not always about **how much money someone makes** —  
it’s about **how much value they place on trust and responsibility**.  

Sometimes, the **real heroes of repayment** aren’t the rich, but the middle-class and lower-income borrowers who prove their commitment every month.
